# Collection of VGM

Collection of my favourite VGM music

This is also the workspace for converting .nsf to .vgm files. Converted folders can be copied directly to SD card to be used in VGMPlayer.

tools/convert_thumbs.py scans each folder for .jpg file and convert it to .sjpg for VGMPlayer. It also saves a copy VGMPlayer.sjpg if the jpg file name matches the folder name.
